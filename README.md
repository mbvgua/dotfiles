<h2> Installation </h2>

To install this onto your system, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbvgua/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
bash setup
```

<h2> Customization </h2>

A good place to customize would be the `.gitconfig` file, change existing variable names to yours

[!WARNING]
> It might be a good idea to back up existing files of the same name as they will be replaced
