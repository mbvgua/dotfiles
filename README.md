# dotfiles

This repo houses dotfiles for my main developer environment. There are many like them, but
but these are mine. Without them I am useless. They contain:
    1.Bash -> terminal
    2.(Neo)Vim -> main text-editor
    3.Vim -> secondary text-editor
    4.tmux -> terminal multiplexer
    5.git -> version controll

Alot of ideas and inspirations were gotten from Vim deities on reddit whose config-fu is 
terrifying and amazing at the same time. If you feel like going down the rollercoster, checkout
the [r/vim](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/) and [r/neovim](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/)
on reddit. They have a lot of nice hacks and inspirational rices.
