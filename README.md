## Why?

Every time I got a new machine, Iâ€™d dive straight into tweaking(changing themes, adding icons, adjusting settings, downloading my preferred apps) all just to make it feel right. But it was always messy and inconsistent. That all changed when I discovered Vim, and how easy it was to configure with just a `.vimrc` file. It opened my eyes to the idea that my environment could be scripted, repeatable, and fully mine.

That led me down the rabbit hole to a deeper realization; in Linux, everything is a file. Dotfiles became my way of capturing those preferences in a clean, version-controlled setup I could carry anywhere. ~~NixOs~~ Dots are reproducible to the core. No more starting from scratch! Just clone, symlink, and go.

## How?

Currently, these dots work neatly on fedora systems, if you have another OS, please change the package manager in the [install.py](./install.py) file accordingly; though not all the packages may be present in the official repositories.

To get this up and running, simply navigate to your `$HOME` directory and:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mbvgua/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    python install.py

    # create symlinks to necessary files
    stow .
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> It might be a good idea to back up existing files of the same name as they will be replaced. A good place to customize would be the `.gitconfig` file, change existing variable names to yours
> 
> A neccessary QoL if you are on the `qtile` WM is adding click support, which allows for click actions using the touchoad. Simply navigate to the `/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf` file and add the "Option" "Tapping" "true" in the below class:
> 
> ```bash
> Section "InputClass"
>         Identifier "libinput touchpad catchall"
>         MatchIsTouchpad "on"
>         MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
>         Driver "libinput"
>         Option "Tapping" "True" # this option here
> EndSection
> ```
