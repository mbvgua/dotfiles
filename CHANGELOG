    Ensue Neovim backs up and swaps files
    
    This neat little trick allows for undoing files even after saving and
    closing the editor. Its pretty cool.
    
    Also incase of instant outage, i can recover files that I was working on
    just as they were. Created their unique tmp directories to prevent them
    being displayed in my current directory.

    Added lualine to config plugins
    
    Decded to go with lualine as my statusline as it was pretty popular and
    also had some nice ricing pics on gh and reddit. Stole peoples config
    mostly. Turned out pretty nice.

    Allow path retention when opening new windows
    
    Previously, when opening new windows, the path was NOT being retained, I
    always had to navigate to where I wanted again from scratch, and in
    instances where I was running a server, say an Angular server,I always
    got an error:'Cannot open outside of directory..' or h
    
    I did have the command to retain the path but it was not working. Turns
    out I had binded c to two commands hence the mix up. With the help or
    reddit neckbeard from r/tmux, I merged it into 1 and was able to fix
    this mixup.

    Add some nifty keybindings
    
    Also made Vim even more lean. Removed alot of unecessary stuff, say in
    the statusbar and such.
    
    Gradually building my Neovim config.

    Removed plugins from Vim
    
    will no longer be using this as my main text-editor, thherefor I removed
    most of the unnecesary plugins, remaining with two:
    - wakatime
    - polyglot for syntax highlighting
    
    Will be using it for simple tasks that do not require the batteries
    included appreoach. But the keymaps I customized are still available for
    use.

    Goodbye Vim. Hellooo (Neo)Vim!
    
    Yeah, realized that I'll never put in the time needed to master
    vimscript as I do not see it practicality elsewhere except in .vimrc's
    hence i switched to (Neo)Vim, which uses Lua as a scripting language,
    and this is also a mulipurpose lang, so Yeahhhhh!

    Move from NERDTree and back to NETRW
    
    NERDTree proved to be too clunky and overhyped for me. I did no know to
    use most of its keybindings and also read the article on vim vinegar
    about project drawers and windows; Decided to move back to netrw as its
    simple, lightweight and does all i need for now.

    Some mods to the .vimrc and tmux theming
    
    1. .tmux.conf:
    - Added some custom theming to tmux which allows better spotting of
    currently active pane.
    - removed redundant <prefix> r that was supposed to be reloading my tmux
      config, but never ever worked, ill be doing it manualy from now on.
    
    2. .vimrc
    - modified the statusline to remove uneccesary file name since it is
      already up above in the tabline
    - added the Conqueror of Completion(CoC) plugin, that turned out to be
      pretty niffty. allows autocompletion like most IDE's. Will come
      in handy moreso in frontend dev
    
    P.S: mahn! i really ought to stop doing this mods and focus on use ;(

    Added a neat trick on HTML
    
    added a neat little trick on html autocompletion I saw from youtube.
    Might come in handy alot in future projects. Also figure out a way to
    modify it for other langs!

    Back to defaults!
    
    Spent almost an entire day trying to make Vim a Vscode rip of with the
    shiny features of code completion and what not. Realized that is not why
    i was learning it in the first place, opted to only refer to docs and
    not rely to heavily oon the code copletion feature.
    
    Also YouCompleteMe and ConquerOfCode are **extremely** bloated in that
    they slowed down my editor significantly. Hopefully wont have to come
    back to them for now.
    
    Also want to take some time off from the 'customizing my .vimrc'
    loophole. Turns out I havent coded much this week, all because of the
    vim frenzy.

    Use the home directory as a git repo
    
    Due to an error with symlinks, I opted to use my home repo as a git
    repo. Pulled the github repo and added the .gitgnore file and this
    allowed me to remove all other contents in my folders.
    
    Incrementally added the neccessary files and everything worked
    
    Worried abit whether creating new files will act as a git submodule, but
    lets see where this will go :)

    Finalized oon the dotfiles
    
    - was finally able to customize my developer environment for me. With
      major help from online blogs, i completed my .vimrc and the .tmux.conf
      files.
    
    - in th e.vimrc, i was able to create a leader key and bind some quick
      shortcuts, of which i am sure to expound on gradually. I opted to go
      with NERDTree instead of the custom netwr as it hhad a lot of
      functionality that I was trying to implement from scratch:
    
      1. how to ensure the same sidebar is on every new tab
      2. how to give it a standard width that will not change or cconsume
         the window size
      3. toggling from a window to a buffer quickly
      4. style netwr better, by removing the ugly '|' icons
    
    - was also able to create a custom status bar, which was pretty cool
      since I thought this was only available on Neovim.
    
    - The installation script is yet to be built, one will have to soley
      rely on manually copying and pasting the commands to get it on your
      device. Will look forward to build that  gradually

    done did basics of window,pane and session amangement. lets goooooo!!

    Changed my plugin manager to vim-plug
    
    After some research realized that Vundle was no longer actively
    maintained. There were some stiff alternatives, but went with vim-plug
    as a lot of advanced vim users recommended it. It also has an easy
    plugin management system and is very fast since processes run asyn.
    
    dein.vim was also a note-worthy alternative, but it requires you to be
    well-versed in vimscript, might consider it later.

    Finally decided to create dotfiles!!
    
    - Recently began being a vim power(ish) user and decided to create
      dotfiles to help me along the journey.
    - After doing some reading on the issue, realized i could also create
      dotfiles for other commonly used tools, git and bash, and so I did
      that
    - Looking forward to seeing this grow gradually
